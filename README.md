# Document Sharing Platform REST API

## Instructions for Running the API Locally

Follow these steps to set up and run the Document Sharing Platform REST API on your local machine:

### Step 1: Clone the Repository




Change your directory to the project folder


### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Install the project dependencies by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt at the root of the project directory:

```bash
npm install
```

This command will download and install all the required dependencies for the API.

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and add the following content to it. This file contains essential configuration settings for the API:

```env
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI='mongodb+srv://your-username:your-password@cluster.mongodb.net/your-database'
JWT_SECRET='your-secret'
```

Replace the placeholders with your specific configuration details:

- `PORT`: The port on which the server will run (e.g., 5000).
- `MONGODB_URI`: The MongoDB connection URI for your database.
- `JWT_SECRET`: Your secret key for JWT authentication.

### Step 4: Start the Server

You can start the server by running the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

The server should now be up and running on the specified port (in this example, port 5000).





## Next Steps

You now have the Document Sharing Platform REST API running locally on your machine. You can explore and interact with the API endpoints using your preferred API testing tool or client.

Feel free to modify the API's functionality or integrate it into your own project as needed.
